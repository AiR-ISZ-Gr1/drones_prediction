# Detection of drone propeller damage
    We developed a program for detecting damage to drone propellers based on data from the accelerometer and gyroscope.

## 1. Use Case
    Technical state monitoring: The system can conduct real-time tests on the drone during its operation, identifying potential propeller damage during flight. This enables a quick response to any issues and prevents potential equipment damage.

## 2. Collecting Data

    The data was collected by our own. To gather data, flights were conducted using an eight-rotor drone. Initially, flights were carried out with all propellers in good condition, followed by series of flights with one damaged propeller measuring 1.5 cm in length. Subsequently, the damaged propeller was replaced with one measuring 3 cm in length, and the series of tests continued.
